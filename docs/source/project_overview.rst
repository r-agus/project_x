Final Project Overview
======================

Analysis of ideological polarization on social networks based on the spread of disinformation content.

General Description
-------------------
The expansion of disinformation on social networks has transformed the way individuals access information and shape their opinions. Numerous studies indicate that the spread of false or manipulated content not only affects the perception of reality, but can also amplify ideological polarization by reinforcing preexisting beliefs within homogeneous communities.

This project examines the relationship between the spread of disinformation and the structure of polarized communities on social networks (e.g., Twitter/X or Facebook). The central hypothesis is that specific patterns of disinformation function as catalysts of polarization, deepening the divide between social and political groups.

Specific Objectives
-------------------
- Identify posts with potentially disinformative content using machine learning techniques and language models.
- Analyze the relationship between the diffusion of disinformation and users' ideological polarization.

Modeling
--------
Train and evaluate predictive classification or regression models using these strategies:

- A neural network implemented in PyTorch.
- Scikit-learn algorithms (SVM and Logistic Regression).
- A pre-trained Transformer model fine-tuned using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

Adequate validation of the models is performed, including explicit separation into training, validation, and test sets.

Comparative Evaluation
----------------------
To assess the impact of different text representations on model performance, the following vectorization methods are employed:

- Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics (accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, etc.).
- Analyze performance differences across vector representations and model architectures.
